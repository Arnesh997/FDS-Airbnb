Airbnb Dataset

Everybody (individuals or groups): We would like you to investigate what makes a good property for Airbnb in Edinburgh. How well can features of a property listing be used to predict its popularity or short-term rental price? Are particular areas or neighbourhoods more sought after or expensive than others?
Groups: The extra questions should extend the basic findings to explore advanced relationships in the data. Examples of questions are:
• Have you identified anything unusual about listings which suggest they are not genuine / true rentals?
• Some Airbnb hosts have multiple listings and may be running them as a business. Do their listings seem more popular than more hosts with single listings?
• The housing policies of cities and towns can be restrictive of short-term rentals, to protect housing for residents. Do features, such as the ‘minimum nights’ setting for listings reveal any patterns that may be indicative of such policies in particular neighbourhoods?
• Any other questions that arise as you explore the data.
